        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hello folks, Saubhanik Chaudhuri here. I am currently studying at IIIT Hyderabad, one of the most renowned institutes for Computer Science. Walking the labyrinthine corridors of academia to understand its tapestry and its mechanisms has really been a major part of my school life and up till now, college life as well, with certain constructive hobbies like numismatism, learning different languages and improving vocabulary of languages I am already somewhat fluent in with a special liking for Sanskrit, pushing in through the narrow corridors of a somewhat chaotic life, with some of them being able to sustain their existence in the long run, while others fade into the ignominious darkness of transience. An ardent fan of ancient history, and with a voracious appetite for knowledge in general, and awed at the possible age of our culture that happens to be so scientifically ‘or’ spiritually evolved, I have so far, made successful attempts at constantly reviving my curiosity and keep learning, just like Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa had said more than a century ago- “I learn as long as I live.” In the academic corridors, I seem to have developed a special liking for pure Mathematics that provides a tough shield against the possible downfall of grades, whereas coding, especially in pressure situations seem to be the weak spot, allowing the demons of those labyrinthine corridors of academia, a possible opportinity for initiation of a quick Blietzkrieg that might possible break open the narrow chink of weakened spots thereby, facilitating a full-scale invasion of my grades. Thus, ever since the first semester has ended, I have been making constant efforts to fill up the gaps and thereby, turn my knowledge into a formidable force that is potentially capable of conquering any unknown terrain.

        A fairly dark-skinned guy, born to Dr. Tushar Kanti Chaudhuri and Ar. Pratichi Bhaumik in the ‘Kashyap’ gothram, on the 3rd of December in the year 2004, in the beautiful town of Agartala in the state of Tripura, today the greatest integer function of my age (in Earth years) stands at 19, and I am hoping to live for at least 81 more Earth years, as it is one of my desires to reach the three-figure mark. Born and brought up amidst greenery and fresh air, with drastically low levels of pollution, and a somewhat hilly landscape, by simple, kind-hearted people has created a natural appreciation and space for ‘Dharma’ and kindness in my heart. Currently a student of CHD Branch studying in IIIT Hyderabad, I am looking forward to doing some form of extensive study, that is, if coordinates permit me to do so, that brings out the links between extremely old native cultures and the Sanatana culture, and pushes back the horizons of the early emergence of the culture even further.
